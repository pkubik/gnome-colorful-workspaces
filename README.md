# Colorful workspaces for Gnome Shell

Adds workspace number indicator to the panel and applies a different color to each workspace.

The idea is to quickly realize whether I ended up in the right terminal before I do any kind of damage to any of my projects.

## Limitations

The code is extremely ugly, especially the CSS stylesheet, but there is too little resources for Gnome. I am disappointed with the developer experience, so I am taking a break right now.

There are 5 colors that are being looped through. You can try to edit them in the stylesheet. It should be relatively easy. You can refer to the commit where I've added the purple color to see how to add more.
